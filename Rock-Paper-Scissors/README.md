# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The project was created to enhance my JavaScript skills, focusing on DOM manipulation and basic game logic.

## Features

- Responsive UI styled with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Interactive gameplay where users can select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly chooses an option.
- Game logic to determine the winner and display the result.
- Basic animations for smooth user experience.
